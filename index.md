Keys pressed: 
```ruby
I typed ssh ssh cs15lfa23ox@ieng6.ucsd.edu <enter> and then at the prompt for the password i typed my password and then <enter>. The output i obtained is in the screenshot above.
```

Note: i required a password as i initially set up the key on a school computer and now it wont let me add another public key. I asked a TA if it mattered if i had a password for this step and they said it was ok.
