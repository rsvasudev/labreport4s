Special Keys pressed: 
```ruby
ssh cs15lfa23ox@ieng6.ucsd.edu <enter> Mypassword1 <enter>.
```
I typed ssh cs15lfa23ox@ieng6.ucsd.edu <enter> and then at the prompt for the password i typed my password and then <enter>. The output i obtained is in the screenshot above. 
Note: I was doing this lab report on a school computer as my laptop broke, where the without password login was setup. I asked a TA if it mattered if i had a password for this step and they said it was ok.
